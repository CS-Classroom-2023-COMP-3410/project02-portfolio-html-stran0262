The development process for my portfolio started with deciding a theme. Once I decided the theme, I chose some colors that worked well with it. I wanted to make the text style to be similar of the gothic style without having to import other fonts, which lead me to italize all the text. In order to get the layout I wanted for the webpages, I used tables with a simply design to display all the information I needed. The two additional pages, used a text link that brought users to different related webpages.

The difficulties I faced was trying to write pure HTML code since I found myself using inline CSS often. Since pure HTML is hard to design with, I struggled to place text or elements where I wanted it. I also had a difficult time trying to upload the website to my CS linux server and get it to show all the images I had. 

I solved these problems by ensuring that all the code I wrote was purely HTML and having to search different ways to do something without using CSS. As mentioned before, I used tables and align to design the layout of all the webpages which normally I wouldn't have done. I also had to ask chatGPT and a friend with help on how to upload my wbesite on to the CS linux server and had to edit the HTML code so that the images and webpages located in different folders were accessible for all webpages.
